The <Specialization text="Condi Virtuoso" name="Virtuoso"/> is a strong condition-based build for <Specialization name="Mesmer"/> in fractals, mainly focusing on <Condition name="Bleeding"/>.

It offers great sustained DPS with a very simple rotation. On top of that it also has a high range and great sustain due to <Trait name="Jagged Mind"/>. At the same time it is quite an independant class with great boon generation, being able to upkeep a good amount of self <Boon name="fury"/> and <Boon name="Might"/> and if traited <Boon name="Quickness"/> from traits in the Dueling and Illusions traitlines. On top of this <Specialization name="Mesmer"/> also cna help provide a significant amount of <Condition name="Vulnerability"/> from <Skill name="Phantasmal Warden"/>.

The <Specialization name="Mesmer"/>also provides an optimal skipping toolset for T4 fractals which should be utilized.


<Divider text="Equipment"/>

<Warning>
This build has very high sustain and therefore you can usually use <Item name="Writ of Masterful Malice"/>.

There are many different gear setups that work very similarly on <Specialization text="Condi Virtuoso" name="Virtuoso"/>. If you want to change the food/utility or sigils, check out the [gear optimizer](https://optimizer.discretize.eu/) for more variants.

This is the default setup when using the <Item type="Sigil" name="Agony"/> at 162 Agony Resistance.

We chose the <Item type="Sigil" name="Agony"/> variant over the <Item type="Sigil" name="Bursting"/> or <Item type="Sigil" name="Geomancy"/> variant since they perform basically identically in fractals but the <Item type="Sigil" name="Agony"/> variant does not rely on <Item name="Writ of Masterful Accuracy"/> to reach crit-cap. This means you will not go below crit-cap when not running a Writ or going below 90% health.

<GridItem sm="6">

<Card title="Information">

Golem rotations out of the raid builds are generally suboptimal in fractals due to <Effect name="Exposed"/> and phases being much shorter compared to raids. The raid rotations are optimized for sustained DPS while in fractals a player needs the ability to adapt a rotation to the amount of time a group needs to finish a phase.

It's important to note that phantasms do not benefit from most modifiers, unless it is stated to be the case.

They do however benefit from <Effect name="Exposed"/>.

<GridItem sm="6">

<Card title="Important Traits">

- <Trait name="Jagged Mind"/> will give you a large amount of sustain and makes your Blade skills inflict <Condition name="Bleeding"/>. Namely, those are your Dagger attacks as well as your Bladesongs.

- <Trait name="Deadly Blades"/> gives you a 5% damage modifier after using a Bladesong. You'll want to keep up this buff as much as you can.

- <Trait name="Bloodsong"/> stocks extra blades when you inflict enough <Condition name="Bleeding"/> and will make sure that you are always at 5 Blades for your Bladesongs as long as you keep attacking.
- <Trait name="Sharper Images"/> makes your Phantasms inflict <Condition name="Bleeding"/> on critical hits, making multi-hit Phantasms stronger. <Trait name="Phantasmal Fury"/> combined with the gear choices will ensure ciritcal hits of your Phantasms.


</Card>
</GridItem>



<GridItem sm="8">

<Card title="Skill priority">

If you lose yourself in the exact rotation, follow this priority list.

1. Use Bladesong skills to keep up the damage buff from <Trait name="Jagged Mind"/>. Make sure to delay <Skill name="Bladesong Sorrow"/> as little as possible and always use it with 5 Blades.
2. Use Phantasms (<Skill name="Phantasmal Swordsman"/> and <Skill name="Phantasmal Warden"/>) whenever ready.
3. Use <Skill name="Signet of the Ether"/> to reset <Skill name="Phantasmal Warden"/>.
4. Use <Skill name="Signet of Illusions"/> to reset your Bladesongs.
5. Use <Skill name="Bladecall"/> and <Skill name="Unstable Bladestorm"/> off-cooldown. You can also weave them in between other attacks, even ones with higher priority.
6. Auto-attack on Dagger.

Remember that your personal damage skills are faster than phantasms, but that they deal more damage over time, this means that direct damaging skills such as Bladecall and auto-attacks get higher priority if the boss is close to phasing.

Utilize <Skill name="Bladesong Dissonance"/> for CC, but also remember to not use too much CC on the breakbar and space out your big CC cooldowns like Signet of Humility so they don't overlap with other powerful CC skills.

Apart from doing DPS, you'll also have access to a wide range of utilities which can all be used for skips, blocks and damage mitigation. Make sure to read what they do and dont be afraid to swap to them situationally, ecpecially in T4s.
