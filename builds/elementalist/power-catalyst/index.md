<Warning>

This build guide is not complete, gear and sections may change regularly as we explore the new elite spec and spend more time playing it in fractals!

</Warning>

The <Specialization name="Catalyst" text="Power Catalyst"/> is currently one of the strongest DPS builds for fractals. <Specialization name="Catalyst" text="Power Catalyst"/> provides <Boon name="Quickness"/>, conjures, <Condition name="Vulnerability"/>, and additional <Boon name="Might"/> through placing fire fields and blasting them. Also it is very useful for some T4 skips like Aetherblade, Cliffside, Thaumanova Reactor etc. thanks to high mobility and <Skill id="5536"/>.

Unfortunately this build is pretty squishy and besides the healing skill does not have any defensive abilities to mitigate damage or cleanse conditions, so high awareness is required. Special care needs to be taken on fractals with <Instability name="We Bleed Fire"/>.

This build has one of the most harder rotations in game which makes it enjoyable to play if given some dedication. The build benefits heavily from slaying potions and sigils such as <Item id="50082"/> and <Item name="Serpent Slaying" type="Sigil"/>.

Check the [gear optimizer](https://optimizer.discretize.eu) for more gear variants!

The stat selection will not change with higher AR / <Trait name="Spotter"/> / <Skill name="Banner of Discipline"/>.

If you want to provide <Boon name="Quickness"/> using <Trait name="Sphere Specialist"/>, you can use the gear below. However, due to the conversion from <Attribute name="Agony Resistance"/> to <Attribute name="Concentration"/> it is more dps increase to play <Trait name="Empowered Empowerment"/> and use diviner gear to make up boon duration.

<Card title="Information">

Golem rotations out of the raid builds are generally suboptimal in fractals due to <Effect name="Exposed"/> and phases being much shorter compared to raids. The raid rotations are optimized for sustained DPS while in fractals a player needs the ability to adapt a rotation to the amount of time a group needs to finish a phase.

<Card title="Precasting">

If a _Mistlock Singularity_ is present you should precast boons and particular effects for better group performance.

- Start on <Skill id="5492"/> and cast <Skill id="63458"/> to provide a fire field.
- Blast it using <Skill name="Molten End"/>, then attune to <Skill id="5495"/> and cast <Skill name="Ground Pound"/>, then attune to <Skill id="5494"/> and cast <Skill name="Shock Blast"/>.
- Precast <Skill id="5506"/> and <Skill id="5635"/>, and swap back to your regular utility skills
- Equip a staff and cast <Skill id="5516"/> while attuning to <Skill id="5492"/>.
- Take the _Mistlock Singularity_.

It is recommended to use separate precast templates to cast different utility and weapon skills.
