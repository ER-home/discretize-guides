The <Specialization name="Willbender" text="Power Willbender"/> is an easy to play build for fractals. It has many similarities with the <Specialization text="Power Dragonhunter" name="Dragonhunter"/> has great burst options and deals high consistent damage while providing medium defiance bar damage and <Condition name="Vulnerability"/>. The build offers a unique party wide offensive buff by sharing <Skill name="bane signet"/> for 216 <Attribute name="Power"/> and also strong on-demand defensive support with skills such as <Skill id="9251"/> and <Skill name="standyourground"/>.

The <Specialization text="Power Willbender" name="Willbender"/> has access to blocks with <Skill name="Shield of Wrath"/>, <Skill name="Crashing Courage"/> and a very strong heal skill (<Skill name="Litany of Wrath"/>). It benefits from slaying potions and slaying sigils such as <Item id="50082"/> and <Item name="Serpent Slaying" type="Sigil"/>.

While this build has less burst damage than the <Specialization text="Power Dragonhunter" name="Dragonhunter"/>, it comes with some other nice benefits:
- Swapping out <Skill name="Whirling Light"/> for another utility to support your group comes at almost no DPS loss.
- If boons are lacking in your group, you can take 2 optional traits (<Trait name="Zealous Scepter"/> and <Trait name="Holy Reckoning"/>) to ensure permanent <Boon name="Might"/> uptime on yourself.
- The Elite skill <Skill name="Heavens Palm"/> provides great extra CC on top of <Skill name="Bane Signet"/>.

<Beginner>

Before progressing to the advanced version of this page, we recommend acquiring an in-depth understanding of your CC skills and when to use them efficiently. You should be able to hit consistently high DPS, which you can verify with [arc-dps](https://www.deltaconnected.com/arcdps/). And finally, you should be able to execute the basic step-by-step rotation provided below without spending too much thought on it.

The advanced page provides a more complete overview of all the utilities the <Specialization name="Guardian"/> has to offer. If you ever feel like you are missing information feel free to already swap to the advanced page!

<Information>

Although this build lists 162 <Attribute name="Agony Resistance"/>, it is not a strict requirement! We recommend getting started with this build anyway - even if it might be suboptimal while being in Tier 1 or 2 fractals. Keep upgrading your <Attribute name="Agony Resistance"/> until you reach the suggested variant. In the beginning, it is much more important to learn about fractal mechanics and your skills rather than equipping optimal gear.

This build assumes you have neither <Skill name="Banner of Discipline"/> nor <Trait name="Spotter"/>.

If you cannot maintain good <Boon name="resolution"/> uptime during your bursts, you may want to play with <Trait name="Healers resolution"/>. By playing this trait you will lose <Attribute name="Precision"/> so will need to adjust your gear to [Crit Cap](/guides/crit-cap/).

<Divider text="Details"/>

As a <Specialization name="Willbender" text="Power Willbender"/> it is important to play <Trait name="perfectinscriptions"/> to be able to use the <Skill name="Banesignet"/> for 300 CC while also sharing the 216 <Attribute name="Power"/> buff with your allies. This enables everyone to deal more damage during critical parts of the fight when the boss is <Effect name="exposed"/>.

Generally it is important to apply <Boon name="Resolution"/> when you are about to burst for the <Trait name="retribution"/> modifier. Thanks to <Trait name="healersresolution"/> your heal skill applies long lasting <Trait name="retribution"/>. Since <Skill name="litanyofwrath"/> has a low cooldown it lines up well with your burst. You can also trigger a <Skill id="13677"/> by losing health below the 75% threshold to trigger <Trait id="648"/>, however you need to be careful to not die.

<Divider text="Rotation / Skill Usage"/>

<Grid>
<GridItem xs="12" sm="7">
<Advanced>
<Card title="Information">

Golem rotations out of the raid builds are generally suboptimal in fractals due to <Effect name="Exposed"/> and phases being much shorter compared to raids. The raid rotations are optimized for sustained DPS while in fractals a player needs the ability to adapt their rotation to the amount of time a group needs to finish a phase.\
For that reason, you will find some general notes for skill usage here.
</Card>

<Card title="Precasting">

If you have a Mistlock Singularity present you can use these skills for precasts:

1.  Cast <Skill name="litany of wrath"/> for <Boon name="Resolution"/>
2.  Use <Skill name="Save yourselves"/> or <Skill name="hallowedground"/>
3.  Blast a fire field with <Skill name="Holy Strike"/>
4.  Use <Skill name="Feelmywrath"/>
5.  Use <Skill name="banesignet"/>
6.  Take mistlock
7.  Blast a fire field with <Skill name="Holy Strike"/> again

</Card>

<Card title="Notes on skill usage:">

- Always start on sword
- Delay swapping to GS until the CC-bar is about to be broken. This is especially important at Ensolyss without instant CC.
- Always cast your <Skill name="whirlingwrath"/> inside the hitbox to get the additional hits. Ideal with adds around.
- Always cast your <Skill name="bindingblade"/> inside the hitbox to get the additional hits when adds are present. Can be abused at **Artsariiv**, **Arkk**, **Siax**, and **Ensolyss**.
- Don't interrupt your GS auto-attack chain.
- In certain scenarios (precasting symbols, starting with <Skill name="onewolfpack"/>) it can be beneficial to get your <Skill name="Rushing Justice"/> out first.
- Don't waste your key skills on meaningless adds.

<Beginner>

<Information>

This build plays very similar to the <Specialization text="Power Dragonhunter" name="Dragonhunter"/> and therefore the rotation as well as step-by-step explanation will be very similar.

</Information>

<Card title="Step-by-Step Rotation">

**Step 0: Bane Signet**

The <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> grants you a passive boost to your <Attribute name="Power"/>. Its active effect (when clicked) will inflict a high amount of CC (300 CC) on your target and share the passive with your allies for 10 seconds through <Trait name="Perfect Inscriptions"/>. Therefore, you want to do the following:

- If a Mistlock Singularity is present, cast <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> there to share its buff right before you run into the fight, then take the singularity.
- If a boss starts with a break bar, you should cast <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> at the start to help with breaking the bar while also sharing its passive to your allies to enhance their burst damage as well.
- If a boss does not get a break bar early into the fight, you can use <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> before the fight starts to share the passive and start right with your burst when the boss spawns.

**Step 1: Greatsword Skills**

The first step consists of using <Skill name="Symbol of Resolution"/>, <Skill name="Whirling Wrath"/> and <Skill name="Binding Blade"/> off-cooldown (in this order of priority if multiple come up at the same time).

- <Skill name="Symbol of Resolution"/> and <Skill name="Whirling Wrath"/> are your 2 biggest damaging weapon skills on the Greatsword.
- Make sure to be in the hitbox of the enemy whenever possible for <Skill name="Whirling Wrath"/>. <Skill name="Whirling Wrath"/> deals additional damage when casted inside a hitbox.
- <Skill name="Binding Blade"/> will deal more damage if you are in the hitbox while there are extra enemies around.

**Step 2: Virtue Skills and Whirling Light**

Next up, it is time to incorporate <Skill name="Rushing Justice"/> and <Skill name="Whirling Light"/>.

- Using <Skill name="Rushing Justice"/> will create <Skill name="Willbender Flames"/> and makes you inflict <Condition name="Burning"/> every few hits. This will grant you a stacking buff from <Trait name="Lethal Tempo"/>. You want to use this skill as soon as possible to start stacking the buff.
- If you precast another Virtue before the fight, you can delay this skill a bit.
- Whenever you need healing or <Boon name="Aegis"/>/<Boon name="Stability"/>, you can use <Skill name="Flowing Resolve"/> or <Skill name="Crashing Courage"/> instead.
- <Skill name="Whirling Light"/> deals high damage and can safely be used off-cooldown. It has lower priority than most of your other skills.
- If you kill certain enemies, your <Skill name="Rushing Justice"/> will reset due to <Trait name="Renewed Justice"/>. In this case, your other skills will still take priority until the current <Skill name="Rushing Justice"/> runs out.
The opener at this step looks like this:

1. <Skill name="Rushing Justice"/>
2. <Skill name="Symbol of Resolution"/>
3. <Skill name="Whirling Wrath"/>
4. <Skill name="Binding Blade"/>
5. <Skill name="Whirling Light"/>

**Step 3: Sword of Justice**

Now it is time to incorporate another strong utility skill, <Skill name="Sword of Justice"/>.

- <Skill name="Sword of Justice"/> has 3 maximum charges. It summons a sword that will deal damage and inflict <Condition name="Vulnerability"/> on nearby enemies while it is active.
- Make sure to use one charge right at the start to help ramping up <Condition name="Vulnerability"/>.
- Afterwards, you can freely use this skill at any point of the rotation.

**Step 4: Sword skills**

This last step will not contribute much to your consistent DPS but can increase your burst by a good amount which is especially important in fights with shorter phases. We will use <Skill name="Symbol of Blades"/> and <Skill name="Zealots Defense"/> at the start of the fight, then swap to Greatsword and do our regular rotation.

The opener should now look like this:

1. <Skill name="Sword of Justice"/>
2. <Skill name="Rushing Justice"/>
3. <Skill name="Symbol of Blades"/>
4. <Skill name="Zealots Defense"/>
5. Swap to Greatsword
6. <Skill name="Symbol of Resolution"/>
7. <Skill name="Whirling Wrath"/>
8. <Skill name="Binding Blade"/>
9. <Skill name="Whirling Light"/>

</Card>

<Card title="Improving Further">

Once you are comfortable with the above steps, you are already doing most of the full rotation and will be able to deal great burst damage and good consistent damage.

There will be a few additional things on the advanced page to improve further but if you got here, you already know the most important things and these will have a smaller impact than what you learned so far.

The additional steps are:

- Incorporate your Focus skills into the rotation, namely <Skill name="Ray of Judgment"/> and <Skill name="Shield of Wrath"/>.
- Weapon swap more often on fights with long phases, usually after using <Skill name="Whirling Wrath"/>/<Skill name="Zealots Defense"/> twice on the respective weapon set.
- Precasts: You can cast lasting skills such as <Skill name="Symbol of Blades"/> before the fight starts to get your damage up earlier and have 1 less cast in your opener.

**Rotation:**

This is just a suggested opener. Depending on the encounter and the length of the phase you will want to start on different weapons and use different skills. <Specialization name="Willbender" text="Power Willbender"/> plays very similarly to <Specialization name="Dragonhunter" text="Power Dragonhunter"/>, if you need some ideas you can use the [Dragonhunter CM Guide](/cm-guides/guardian/power-dragonhunter/static/).

1.  <Skill name="banesignet" profession="guardian"/>
2.  <Skill name="Symbol of Blades" profession="guardian"/> (Sword 2)
3.  <Skill name="Shield of Wrath" profession="guardian"/> (Focus 5)
4.  <Skill name="Sword of Justice" profession="guardian"/>
5.  <Skill name="Ray of Judgment" profession="guardian"/> (Focus 4)
6.  <Skill name="Rushing Justice" profession="guardian"/> (F1)
7.  <Skill name="Zealotsdefense" profession="guardian"/> (Sword 3)
8.  **Weapon Swap**
9.  <Skill name="Symbol of Resolution" profession="guardian"/> (GS 4)
10. <Skill name="Whirling Wrath" profession="guardian"/> (GS 2)
11. <Skill name="Whirling Light" profession="guardian"/>

13. <Skill name="Sword of Justice" profession="guardian"/>
14. <Skill name="Leap of Faith" profession="guardian"/> (GS 3)
15. <Skill name="Binding Blade" profession="guardian"/> (GS 5)
