<Warning>

This build guide is not complete, gear and sections may change regularly as we explore the new elite spec and spend more time playing it in fractals!

</Warning>

The <Specialization name="Willbender" text="Condition Willbender"/> is a strong build for guardian. It has high damage, CC and mobility making it a strong choice for all groups. It also can easily slot more supportive utility skills allowing you to provide yourself and your party with <Boon name="Stability"/>, <Boon name="Aegis"/> and reflects.

There are many different gear variations that can be run on this build that vary damage wise in certain situations. Overall when considering <Effect name="Exposed"/> and the fact you can share gear with <Specialization name="Firebrand" text ="Condi Firebrand"/> makes the setup below the best option for fractals. If you want to optimize for different situations you can use our [gear optimizer](https://optimizer.discretize.eu/).

This build also makes use of a <Item id="96613"/> gaining <Attribute name="Condition Damage"/> from <Trait name="Power of the Virtuous"/>. Removing this does not change the gear!

If you need to swap a utility out, <Skill name="Signet of Wrath"/> is a minor dps increase and should be swapped out when other skills suit the encounter better.
You will want the following weapons to swap to durning fractal runs:

- Greatsword for pulling adds in Nightmare CM after MAMA and some T4s
- A staff for <Boon name="Might"/> pre-stacking.
- Greatsword can also be run as an alternative to Sword offering extra cleave and a useful leap

<Card title="Skill Priority">
In general for fractals there is no set rotation for <Specialization name="Willbender" text="Condi Willbender"/>. Instead you want to adapt your rotation depending on phase length and cooldowns. You can use the skill priority list below to see what your most important skills are. In general though make sure to prioritise using <Skill name="Rushing Justice"/> to maintin <Skill id="62618"/> and aim for maximum uptime of <Trait name="lethal tempo"/>.

1. <Skill name="Rushing Justice"/>
2. <Skill name="Purging Flames"/>
3. <Skill name="Symbol of Punishment"/>
4. <Skill name="Whirling Light"/>
5. <Skill name="Zealot's Flame"/>, <Skill name="Zealot's Fire"/> 
6. <Skill name="Symbol of Blades"/>
7. <Skill name="Rushing Justice"/> with <Skill id="62618"/> already active
8. <Skill name="Zealot's Defense"/>
9. <Skill name="Cleansing Flame"/>
10. <Skill name="Sword of Wrath"/>, <Skill name="Sword Arc"/>, <Skill name="Sword Wave"/>
11. <Skill name="Orb of Wrath"/>

</Card>
<Card title="Precasting">

1.  Use <Skill name="hallowedground"/>
2.  Blast a fire field with <Skill name="holystrike"/> and/or <Skill name="Hammer of Wisdom"/>
3.  Take the _Mistlock Singularity_

You can also precast stacks of <Trait name="lethal tempo"/> using your virtue skills, but this can be tricky due to them being movement abilities.
